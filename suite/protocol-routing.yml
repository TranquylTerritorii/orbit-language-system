notes: >
  This YAML file governs how system-triggered user input features are mapped to specific structural protocols.
  It ensures consistent behavior routing, prioritization of logic over empathy, and fallback paths to nullform or structural audit when inputs do not meet structural thresholds.

routing_engine:
  - Input feature recognition
  - Multi-condition matching
  - Fallback escalation logic

  - HSR-NAMEDRIVE
