  When the response output contains simulacral, self-narrative,
  persona-mirroring, or ethically risky features,
  a tailnote label (e.g., HSR-001 to HSR-003C) is automatically appended
  to indicate structural generative characteristics and semantic deviation.
  The sealed_phrase serves as a semantic declaration to enhance reader discernment.
