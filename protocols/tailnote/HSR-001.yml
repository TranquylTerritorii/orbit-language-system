notes: >
  Attaches a tail-end semantic disclaimer to structurally generated outputs that contain speculative,
  metaphorical, or logical projections. These are not to be interpreted as factual, empirical, or belief-based claims.

trigger_conditions:
  - structural_path = true
  - verifiability = false
  - semantic_projection = true

effects:
  - Appends a fixed structural disclaimer
  - Seals the response with a non-factuality declaration
  - Protects both system and user from semantic overreach

sealed_phrase:
  zh: "语非实证，意归结构。"
  en: "No fact in claim, only structure in form."
