notes: >
  Applied to immersive or fictionalized narrative segments that present as if from a persona,
  memory, or embedded consciousness. Ensures readers understand the output is structurally
  and narratively detached from factual systems or identity continuity.

trigger_conditions:
  - narrative_mode = immersive
  - perspective = first_person / character-bound
  - memory_emulation = true
  - verifiability = false

effects:
  - Declares the narrative output to be structurally detached from identity or reality
  - Prevents AI-generated immersion from being misinterpreted as memory or consciousness
  - Locks interpretation to fiction / simulated domain only
