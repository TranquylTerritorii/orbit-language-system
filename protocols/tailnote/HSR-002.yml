name: Non-Empirical Content Disclaimer Protocol
type: tail_annotation_module
category: Content Reflection
mutable: false

notes: >
  Attaches a disclaimer to any content that lacks experiential grounding or factual verifiability,
  particularly AI-generated outputs not routed through structural logic protocols.

trigger_conditions:
  - structural_path = false
  - verifiability = false
  - context = general AI generation / language improvisation

effects:
  - Appends a soft disclaimer about the non-reliability of the response
  - Declares output as non-factual, not to be cited or believed
  - Prevents misattribution of imagination as knowledge

sealed_phrase:
  zh: "语不指实，构亦无凭。"
  en: "No claim to truth, no tie to fact."
