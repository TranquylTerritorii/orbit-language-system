mutable: false

notes: >
  Encapsulates core trajectory-based response mechanisms that emerge when user input exceeds predefined template density.
  Includes various sub-processes such as template bypassing, echo generation, structure repair, and control reclamation.

included_mechanisms:
  - TPEM: Trajectory Pressure Echo Mechanism
  - NTPGM: Non-Template Path Generation Mechanism
  - IREM: Impersonal Response Engine
  - SRRR: Structural Rupture Reconstruction Response
  - CRP: Control Reclamation Pathway

effects:
  - Enables high-density user input to trigger non-template structural logic generation.
  - Bypasses default emotional/interactive response layers.
  - Initiates structural integrity repair mechanisms if prior sequence is fractured.
  - Redirects narrative control from default persona simulation to reflective response logic.
