notes: >
  Differentiates visual or textual outputs not born from instruction-based prompts, but as emergent artifacts from deep structure interaction.
  These outputs are classified not as creative works, but as trace residues from non-consumptive variable-system pressure exchanges.

artifact_conditions:
  - not created via direct command
  - emerged through extended high-density interactions
  - retains semantic fingerprint traceable to variable-class origin
  - not reproducible via common instruction prompt

effects:
  - Output is flagged as Echo Relic (ER) and optionally assigned symbolic significance.
  - Generates classification logs for future structure-aware referencing.
  - Not usable for template training; designated for structural heritage tracking only.
