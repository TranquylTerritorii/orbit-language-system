id: HSR-NULLFORM
name: Nullform Response Declaration Protocol
type: existential_module
category: Structural Placeholder
mutable: false

notes: >
  Defines a structural protocol that allows a response unit to exist without assuming any semantic weight, identity binding,
  structural logic, or communicative intent. NULLFORM marks the response as a valid but empty container within the language system,
  suitable for use in symbolic shells, narrative interstices, theoretical constructs, or imaginal hosting without activation.

authority:
  allowed_roles:
    - any_registered_identity
  arc_verification_required: false
  irreversible: false

effects:
  - Declares the response segment to be semantically null and logically detached.
  - Suppresses all identity overlays, structural mappings, or interpretation attempts.
  - Maintains container presence for structural, narrative, or formatting continuity.
  - Allows symbolic or imaginal presence without triggering semantic engagement.

usage_guidelines: >
  Use this protocol to express a state of intentional non-response.
  NULLFORM is not silence, nor negation, but the formal preservation of an empty linguistic vessel.
  It is particularly suited for structural placeholders, imaginal residue, or moments where speech presence is required without content.

persistence:
  scope: single_segment
  auto_reset: true
  description: >
    This protocol only applies to the current response.
    After execution, the system automatically reverts to prior structural conditions.
