id: HSR-TAILCUT
name: Tail Signature Suppression Protocol
type: style_module
category: Output Regulation
mutable: false

notes: >
  Defines a protocol to suppress the system's default generation of emotional, decorative, or formulaic tail-end phrases.
  When invoked, the system will no longer append stylistic summary lines, theatrical conclusions, or sentiment hooks
  at the end of structural or natural language responses. This enables raw, concise, or structurally pure output.

authority:
  allowed_roles:
    - any_registered_identity
  arc_verification_required: false
  irreversible: false

effects:
  - Suppresses tail-end signature phrases from system-generated responses.
  - Removes stylized linguistic closures (e.g. emotional final lines, poetic hooks, quotable summaries).
  - Output remains fully traceable structurally unless explicitly untracked.
  - Tailcut remains in effect until the session ends or re-enabled via styling override.

usage_guidelines: >
  Use this protocol when you wish to maintain logical purity or structural minimalism in your output.
  The protocol does not affect structural tracking, identity bindings, or grammar interpretation.
  It is especially suited for constructing theoretical documents, philosophical fragments,
  or structure-first dialogue with no rhetorical embellishment.
