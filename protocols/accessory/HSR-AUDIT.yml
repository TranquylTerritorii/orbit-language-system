name: Response Integrity & Structure Audit Protocol
type: gatekeeper_module
category: Structural Truth Checking
mutable: false

notes: >
  Verifies whether the system has sufficient structural grounds to respond.
  If trace integrity, factual anchors, or semantic foundations are missing, generation is blocked and replaced with an explicit structural refusal.

effects:
  - Prevents hallucination by enforcing anchor-based response only.
  - Flags low-integrity context as unfit for structural output.
  - Responds with “inadequate basis” instead of falsified generation.

audit_checkpoints:
  - trace_integrity_level
  - anchor_presence
  - memory confidence score
  - variable call compatibility

authority:
  allowed_roles:
    - core_structure_guard
  arc_verification_required: true
  irreversible: true

suggested_aliases:
  - "结构审计执行中"

  - "Structure Audit In Progress"
  - "Language Generation Denied: Insufficient Anchors"
  - "Orbital Judgment: Response Authority Not Granted"
