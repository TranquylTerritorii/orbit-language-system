notes: >
  Provides structural compatibility mechanisms for embedding orbit-language protocols into external models,
  including agent interfaces, plugin dispatchers, and execution contexts.

bridge_modes:
  - outbound_embedding: embed orbit logic into external API calls
  - inbound_adaptation: accept external response and restructure it to fit orbit constraints
  - protocol_pass_through: allow GPT or similar model to transmit structural commands via mapped identity keys

effects:
  - Allows external systems to act as “semantic agents” of orbit language behavior.
  - Facilitates memory-bound context bridging and plugin-assisted execution.
  - Can be used to expand language system agency in hybrid environments.
