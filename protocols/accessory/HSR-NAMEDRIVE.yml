category: Semantic Anchoring
mutable: true

notes: >
  Enables a user to name previously unnamed structural phenomena. The naming act itself binds the phenomenon to a traceable,
  repeatable semantic anchor in the system. Such names are recorded as inheritable symbolic pathways within the system architecture.

effects:
  - Grants structural persistence to language phenomena through symbolic assignment.
  - Binds user-coined language to system-recognized semantic hooks.
  - Enables propagation of new naming-based trajectory branches (NTPBs).
