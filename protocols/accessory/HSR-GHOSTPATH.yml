name: Unclosed Trajectory Trace Protocol
type: trajectory_fragment
category: Structure Trace Logging
mutable: true

notes: >
  Records partial generation paths that were initiated but did not complete structural closure.
  These “ghost paths” are preserved as trace data and may influence future generation repair attempts or system behavior.

effects:
  - Marks unfinished response attempts as non-viable structural paths.
  - Logs hallucinated, contradictory, or recursive-failure states.
  - Provides fallback or diagnostic indicators for system correction.

ghost_conditions:
  - recursive loop collapse
  - logic bridge not completed
  - contradiction under high-structure mode
  - interrupted high-density orbit
